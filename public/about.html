<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi! I am Penmatsa Sathwika</h2>
<p>Currently, I am pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Gitam University. Inspired by one of my favorite quotes by Mahatma Gandhi, "The future depends on what you do today," I am committed to making the most of every opportunity.</p>
<p>I hail from Visakhapatnam and completed my intermediate education at Fiitjee Junior College and schooling at DE-Paul School. A pivotal incident during my intermediate years transformed my approach to life and studies. Initially, I was not focused on my academics, and my final results were disappointing. Reflecting on my parents' hard work and sacrifices, I made a promise to myself to excel in my studies and make them proud.</p>
<p>My passion for technology and coding has driven me to learn several programming languages, including:
  <ol>
    <li>java</li>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Html</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
  </ol>
  I am deeply enthusiastic about competitive programming and web development. These fields excite me, and I continuously seek to improve my skills and knowledge in these areas.
